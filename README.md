# Reinforcement-Learning
Putting the RL to Use
## What is RL

### Concepts 
The there are four fundamental concepts that 
underpin most RL projects.    
These are:-    
 **Agent** : the actor operating within the environment, it is usually governed by a policy (a rule that decides what action to take)     
 **Environment** : the world in which the agent can operate in.    
 **Action** : the agent can do something within the environment known as an action.    
 **Reward and Observations** : in **return** the agent receives a reward and a view of what the environment looks like after acting on it.   
 


### Applications of RL 
There are a range of applications for reinforcement learning. Including: 
1. Autonomous Driving 
2. Securities Trading 
3. Neural Network Architecture Search 
4. Simulated Training of Robots 

### Limitations and Considerations 
  • For simple problems RL can be overkill     
  • Assumes the environment is Markovian (Future Sate depends on the Past State)    
  • Training can take a long time and is not always stable
